    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Book Review of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ is the second of the trilogy of Jules Verne (the first is the “Captain Grant’s daughter”, and the third is the “Mysterious Island”), is mainly about the story of the Nautilus submarine. In 1866, some people asserted that a narwhal could be seen in the sea, the French biologist Aronnax finally found that it is a submarine called Nautilus. Then he took the servant Conseil and a whaler, together with Captain Nemo, taking the submarine in the sea to have a twenty-thousand-mile global venturesome travel. In the book, Nemo is a mysterious role of unknown nationality. The submarine he built secretly on a desert island was not only rugged, but also ingeniously constructed and able to use the ocean to provide energy. Aronnax, through a series of strange things, finally learned that the mysterious Captain Nemo still keep in touch with the mainland, using the seabed wreck of millions of gold and silver to support the people on the land of justice struggle! The reason why Verne’s novels have so many readers is that they are skilful in conceptions and thrilling in plots. The book depicts the people in the sea of all kinds of wonderful adventures. Submarines shuttled freely in the sea, sometimes at a crucial and dangerous moment, sometimes in quite colourful scenery. The beautiful and spectacular underwater world is full of exotic and strong romanticism, embodies the human beings’ desire from the ancient time that can fly in the sky and travel in the sea. Verne hadn’t go to the bottom of the sea, but scene of the underwater world was so vivid and fascinating that readers are feel immersive, this book also shows that Jules Verne himself has the extraordinary imagination. The reason why Verne’s novels are so moving is that they are the result of ingenious combination of science and fantasy. Verne’s life is very diligent, relying on reading to obtain a wealth of scientific knowledge. His unique fantasy, which conforms scientific principles, has become a reasoning and prophecy on the basis of scientific research. Many of his scientific fantasies have been proved by later discoveries. Now, not only the submarines have already become realities, even the dreams that landing on the moon, taking flights in space have been achieved as well. His novels are convincing because of their scientific basis, which can not only stimulate people’s interest in science, but also inspire people to think and make them boldly fantasy about what the future like. Therefore, Jules Verne is recognised as “the father of modern scientific fiction”. The reason why Verne’s novel is widely circulated is that he has a sense of social justice and lofty humanitarianism spirit. The characters in his novels are brave and tenacious, fearless and noble in qualities, deeply devoted to science. The image of soldiers fighting against oppression, such as Captain Nemo, is more than a reflection of his progressive thoughts that against colonialism and against slavery and oppressors. If you haven’t read this book or other scientific fictions written by Verne yet, what a pity! Otherwise, the plots of Verne’s novels’ are all in connections, which constitute “The Verne’s World”! Have a read in the course of your spare time, you will feel like one of the characters in Verne’s book!]]></content>
