    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The history of human social development proves that ecological prosperity and recession are closely related to the existence of civilisation. After the Industrial Revolution, mankind relied on scientific and technological progress to create a miracle of industrialisation, and the attitude towards nature was changed from awe to conquer. Most of the traditional economic development models are unscientific, which ignored the consumption of resources by economic growth, the pollution of the environment and the destruction of the ecology. They paid much attention to local interests, ignoring the future generations’ interests, the natural ecology, also the protection of other creatures, which had given rise to a serious global ecological crisis. As Engels pointed out, “We should not be too fascinated by our human’s victory in nature. For every such victory, nature has retaliated against us.” Our nation has always respected nature, loved nature, and bred a splendid ecological culture, such as “Tao models itself after nature”, “Man-earth harmony”. The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the construction of ecological civilisation. After the reform and opening up, it has successively established “protecting the environment” and “saving resources” as basic national policies. However, in our nation, due to various reasons of history and reality, environmental protection in some places cannot fully keep pace with economic development. Garbage siege and ecological damage occurred from time to time. The environment is the people’s livelihood, the green hill is beauty, the blue sky is happiness, and lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. In order to meet the people’s growing needs of beautiful ecological environment, the Chinese leadership, with President Xi Jinping at the core, regards ecological civilisation construction as important content, and has put forward many strategic layouts, focusing on preventing and controlling problems of contamination, accelerating the construction of ecological civilisation top-level design and institutional system, strengthening the construction of the rules of law vigorously to promote green development. China’s ecological civilisation construction has achieved remarkable results, and the construction of “Beautiful China” has also taken a firm step. Currently, ecological civilisation construction still faces many difficulties and challenges–the grim situation of tight resource constraints, serious environmental pollution, and degraded ecosystems. We must form an ecological civilisation concept to promote the formation of a new pattern of harmonious development of man and nature, that respects nature, conforms to nature, and protects nature, and puts ecological civilisation construction in a prominent position, integrating into all aspects and whole processes of economic, political, cultural and social construction just as treating our own lives. Efforts ought be made to promote the green transformation of industrial structure, spatial, energy, consumption structure, establishing and improving the economic system of low-carbon and sustainable development. The construction of ecological civilisation is conducive to the present and the future. We must make efforts to protect the ecological environment for our generation, making China’s land bluer, greener, clearer, and the environment more beautiful.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[As is mentioned in the title of my article, this is the key sentence that President Xi said in his New Year speech this year, which can be said to be buzzwords. In the past 2017, we have experienced a high school entrance examination, crossed the first mark of our life. What a great achievement it is! Nevertheless, we still have a long way to go. Four months earlier, we entered the senior high as it wishes, meeting new teachers and classmates, with learning pressure and challenges followed one after another. Facing these, we shall never give up at this main point in life. No matter how difficult it is, we shouldn’t give up as we do not have the phrase “ give up” in our dictionary. No matter how complicated the matter I am facing is, I always believe firmly: I can make it! “Our eyes may be filled with all kinds of struggling, but learning itself will lead to poetry and far-away destination.” Behind all of these, there is meticulous concern of our classmates, educators’ earnest teachings, family’s ardent expectations. There is no doubt for us to work hard to make our dreams come true. Martin Luther King had his own dream, which was to let the blacks get the equal rights as whites had. Winston Churchill had his own dream, which was to unite the British people to fight bravely and unyieldingly. I also have my own dream. Maybe in the short term, I will go to a good university or go abroad for further study, but in the long run, I should contribute to the entire society and even the Chinese nation. To achieve these, firstly, I should understand the importance of learning and take studying as the primary task at present. In addition, I should work hard to learn the science and culture, which makes me feel a sense of superiority. Last but not least, I should read quite a few books to improve my knowledge level. “A nine-storey tower begins with a pile of earth.” To translate the blueprint into reality, we must neither rush upon fantasy nor be guided by the sound of falsehood, only shall we work steadily and in a down-to-earth manner. Time elapses quickly, while I firmly believe that “Happiness is achieved through hard work”, it is our own hands that create a better future!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Book Review of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ is the second of the trilogy of Jules Verne (the first is the “Captain Grant’s daughter”, and the third is the “Mysterious Island”), is mainly about the story of the Nautilus submarine. In 1866, some people asserted that a narwhal could be seen in the sea, the French biologist Aronnax finally found that it is a submarine called Nautilus. Then he took the servant Conseil and a whaler, together with Captain Nemo, taking the submarine in the sea to have a twenty-thousand-mile global venturesome travel. In the book, Nemo is a mysterious role of unknown nationality. The submarine he built secretly on a desert island was not only rugged, but also ingeniously constructed and able to use the ocean to provide energy. Aronnax, through a series of strange things, finally learned that the mysterious Captain Nemo still keep in touch with the mainland, using the seabed wreck of millions of gold and silver to support the people on the land of justice struggle! The reason why Verne’s novels have so many readers is that they are skilful in conceptions and thrilling in plots. The book depicts the people in the sea of all kinds of wonderful adventures. Submarines shuttled freely in the sea, sometimes at a crucial and dangerous moment, sometimes in quite colourful scenery. The beautiful and spectacular underwater world is full of exotic and strong romanticism, embodies the human beings’ desire from the ancient time that can fly in the sky and travel in the sea. Verne hadn’t go to the bottom of the sea, but scene of the underwater world was so vivid and fascinating that readers are feel immersive, this book also shows that Jules Verne himself has the extraordinary imagination. The reason why Verne’s novels are so moving is that they are the result of ingenious combination of science and fantasy. Verne’s life is very diligent, relying on reading to obtain a wealth of scientific knowledge. His unique fantasy, which conforms scientific principles, has become a reasoning and prophecy on the basis of scientific research. Many of his scientific fantasies have been proved by later discoveries. Now, not only the submarines have already become realities, even the dreams that landing on the moon, taking flights in space have been achieved as well. His novels are convincing because of their scientific basis, which can not only stimulate people’s interest in science, but also inspire people to think and make them boldly fantasy about what the future like. Therefore, Jules Verne is recognised as “the father of modern scientific fiction”. The reason why Verne’s novel is widely circulated is that he has a sense of social justice and lofty humanitarianism spirit. The characters in his novels are brave and tenacious, fearless and noble in qualities, deeply devoted to science. The image of soldiers fighting against oppression, such as Captain Nemo, is more than a reflection of his progressive thoughts that against colonialism and against slavery and oppressors. If you haven’t read this book or other scientific fictions written by Verne yet, what a pity! Otherwise, the plots of Verne’s novels’ are all in connections, which constitute “The Verne’s World”! Have a read in the course of your spare time, you will feel like one of the characters in Verne’s book!]]></content>
